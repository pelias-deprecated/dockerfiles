# Pelias Dockerfiles

This is a [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose#docker-compose) based demo application for running the [Pelias Geocoder](https://github.com/pelias/pelias).

It is configured to set up a geocoder for Portland, Oregon, USA and should be able to do so in about 30 minutes with a fast internet connection.

Many options can be changed to support local development or use for other cities. However, it is not suitable for full planet geocoding installations. For that, see our [install documentation](https://pelias.io/install.html)

## Step-by-step Guide

Check out a [self-contained workshop](how_to_guide.pdf) that explains all the moving parts that make up the Pelias geocoding engine
and then shows you how to setup a geocoder for a single city or county right on your own machine.

**Warning:** Copy/paste from the JSON in this workshop PDF is currently broken. See https://github.com/pelias/dockerfiles/issues/33 for details.

### Prerequisites
1. Docker version `1.10.1` or later.

1. A directory for storing downloaded datasets. This directory should have at least 30GB disk space free

1. **OSX Only**
    1. In Docker > Preferences > Advanced, set the CPU to `4` and memory to `12 GB`. This ensures that Docker has enough memory to run the imports and API.

#### Create a Directory for Your Data

This is where all the data from OpenStreetMap, OpenAddresses, etc will be downloaded. All of the containers are already configured to use this data.

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/data
```

If you wish to change the location of your data directory you can simply change the `DATA_DIR` environment variable defined in the `.env` file.

## Getting Up and Running

First you'll need to create (or edit) the provided `pelias.json` file at the root of the repository.
This is where you will specify all the details of your desired Pelias instance, such as area of coverage and data sources.
You can reference the individual data sections below for more details on configuration.

Once that's ready, the following command will build all the images and containers required:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Once the process is complete you can list the running services:

```bash
docker-compose ps
        Name                   Command           State                 Ports               
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pelias_api             npm start                 Up       0.0.0.0:4000->4000/tcp           
pelias_elasticsearch   /bin/bash bin/es-docker   Up       0.0.0.0:9200->9200/tcp, 9300/tcp
pelias_geonames        /bin/bash                 Exit 0
pelias_interpolation   npm start                 Up       0.0.0.0:4300->4300/tcp
pelias_openaddresses   /bin/bash                 Exit 0                                    
pelias_openstreetmap   /bin/bash                 Exit 0
pelias_pip             npm start                 Up       0.0.0.0:4200->4200/tcp
pelias_placeholder     npm start                 Up       0.0.0.0:4100->4100/tcp           
pelias_polylines       /bin/bash                 Exit 0                                    
pelias_schema          /bin/bash                 Exit 0                                    
pelias_whosonfirst     /bin/bash                 Exit 0
```

## Checking that Services are Running
All the services should be up and running after the build script completes. The ports on which the services run should match
the configuration in `docker-compose.yml`. You can confirm this worked correctly by visiting each one at the corresponding URLs.

### API
http://localhost:4000/v1/search?text=portland

## Data Download and Import

You can run `./prep_data.sh` to download and import data after changing configuration settings or to update existing data.

Below are configuration options for the various data sources.

```bash
mdkir -p /tmp/data
sh ./prep_data.sh
```

### Individual Data Sources

#### Who's on First

*note: this guide only covers importing the admin areas (like cities, countries etc.)*

##### configuration
For WOF data, use `imports.whosonfirst.importPlace` (see [whosonfirst repo doc](https://github.com/pelias/whosonfirst#configuration))

```javascript
"imports": {
  "whosonfirst": {
    "datapath": "/data/whosonfirst",
    "importVenues": false,
    "importPostalcodes": true,
    "importPlace": "101715829"
  }
}
```

##### download

```bash
docker-compose run --rm whosonfirst npm run download
```

##### import

```bash
docker-compose run --rm whosonfirst bash -c 'npm start'
```

#### OpenAddresses

##### configuration
For OA data, use `imports.openaddresses.files` (see [openaddresses repo doc](https://github.com/pelias/openaddresses#configuration))

```javascript
"imports": {
  "openaddresses": {
    "datapath": "/data/openaddresses",
    "files": [ "us/or/portland_metro.csv" ]
  }
}
```

##### download
```bash
docker-compose run --rm openaddresses npm run download
```

##### import
```bash
docker-compose run --rm openaddresses npm start
```

#### OpenStreetMap

Any moderately sized `osm.pbf` file will work.
##### configuration
Once you find a URL from which you can consistently download the data, specify it in the configuration file and
the download script will pull it down for you.

For OSM data, use `imports.openstreetmap.download[]` (see [openstreetmap repo doc](https://github.com/pelias/openstreetmap#configuration))

```javascript
"imports": {
  "openstreetmap": {
    "download": [
      {
        "sourceURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.nextzen.org/portland_oregon.osm.pbf"
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
}
```

###### download

Using the download script in the container:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm openstreetmap npm run download
```

Or, download the data by other means such as `wget` (example for Singapore):

```bash
wget -qO- https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.nextzen.org/singapore.osm.pbf > /tmp/data/openstreetmap/extract.osm.pbf
```

##### import

```bash
docker-compose run --rm openstreetmap npm start
```

#### Geonames

##### configuration

You can restrict the downloader to a single country by adding a `countryCode` property in your `pelias.json`:

```javascript
"imports": {
  "geonames": {
    ...
    "countryCode": "SG"
  }
}
```

##### download

```bash
docker-compose run --rm geonames npm run download
```

#### import

```bash
docker-compose run --rm geonames npm start
```

## Polylines

##### configuration

```javascript
"imports": {
  "polyline": {
    "datapath": "/data/polylines",
    "files": ["pbf_extract.polyline"]
  }
}
```

##### download
The extract of the polylines is done using the OSM pbf file so that must be downloaded first. See OpenStreetMap section for details on that.
Once the pbf extract is in place, run the following command.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm polylines sh ./docker_extract.sh
```

##### import

```bash
docker-compose run --rm polylines npm run start
```

## Interpolation

The [interpolation engine](https://github.com/pelias/interpolation/) combines OpenStreetMap, OpenAddresses, and TIGER (a USA-only address range dataset). See its project README for more configuration options.

## Setting Up Elasticsearch

This will take place as part of the build script, but in the case you'd like to manually manipulate the schema,
the following command will install the pelias schema in elasticsearch:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm schema bash -c 'node scripts/create_index.js'
```

You can confirm this worked correctly by visiting http://localhost:9200/pelias/_mapping


## Shutting Down and Restarting
To stop all the containers, `docker-compose down`.

Restart all the containers with `docker-compose up` or `sh ./run_services.sh`.

## Saving docker images as tar files

Docker images can be saved for offline use with the following command:

```bash
docker images --filter 'reference=pelias/*:latest' --format '{{.Repository}}' | parallel --no-notice docker save -o '{/.}.tar' {}
```
